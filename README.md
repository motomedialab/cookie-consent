## Cookie Consent

A flexible, highly configurable, mobile friendly, drop in JavaScript consent script that interacts directly with Google
Tag
manager [Consent Overview](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/10718549?hl=en).

Built with EU cookie consent and the dreaded GDPR standards in mind!

### Installation

#### NPM

`npm install @motomedialab/cookie-consent --save`

```javascript
// import the module within your javascript
// this must be done after configuring tag manager and options
import '@motomedialab/cookie-consent';
```

#### CDN

```html

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@motomedialab/cookie-consent@latest" type="module"></script>
```

### Configuring Google Tag Manager

There is a little pre-work as detailed in the example code below. Once installed, the script will automatically apply
the Tag Manager consent settings, and will emit a `cookieConsent` event to Tag Manager when these preferences
are initialised/changed.

If you haven't done so already, you need to enable 'Consent Overview' in your Tag Manager account. This can be found
within Admin > Container Settings > Additional Settings

![Enable Consent Overview](https://mtcm-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/packages/%40motomedialab/cookie-consent/enable-consent-overview.png)

For information on configuring Tag Manager for Consent Overview, see the
documentation: [Consent Overview](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/10718549?hl=en)

Once this is done, you can then create a custom event *trigger* in Tag Manager to listen for this event, and use it to
fire your *tags*, based on the users consent level.

![TagManager Trigger](https://mtcm-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/packages/%40motomedialab/cookie-consent/trigger.png)

You can then add your newly created trigger to as a firing trigger for each event and configure each tag according to
the required consent level:

That's it, your Tag Manager should now be ready! Make sure to test your configuration in Preview Mode before publishing
your changes.
